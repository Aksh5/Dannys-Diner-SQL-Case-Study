# 🍜 Danny's Diner - SQL Case Study

This project is part of my SQL learning journey. Using a fictional dataset from [Danny Ma's 8-week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com), I solved business-related questions to demonstrate skills in SQL querying, joins, aggregations, CTEs, and analytical thinking.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

Three tables were used:

1. **sales**
   - customer_id
   - order_date
   - product_id

2. **menu**
   - product_id
   - product_name
   - price

3. **members**
   - customer_id
   - join_date

## 📌 Questions Solved

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $10 spent equates to 1 point, how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins, they earn 2x points on all items. Calculate total points considering this rule.
